Unused vacation days can be carried over to the next year, but a maximum of 5 days only.

Employees are entitled to 10 sick days per year. If you are sick, notify your manager before 9:00 AM on the day of absence. A doctor's note is required for absences longer than three consecutive days. Sick days do not accumulate and cannot be carried over to the next year.
 
Health and Benefits
The company provides comprehensive health insurance covering medical, dental, and vision care. Health insurance coverage begins on the first day of employment. Employees can add dependents to their health plan. The company covers 80 percent of the premium cost for employees. Dependent coverage is available at employee expense. Annual health checkups are encouraged and fully covered.

All employees receive a 15 percent discount on company products. The employee discount applies to both online and in-store purchases. Discounts cannot be combined with other promotional offers. Family members can use the employee discount with proper authorization. The discount privilege may be suspended for policy violations.
 
Professional Development
ACME Corporation supports employee growth and learning. Employees can attend up to two professional conferences per year with company funding. The training budget is $2000 per employee annually. Employees must submit training requests to their manager for approval. Online courses and certifications are eligible for reimbursement. Any training directly related to job responsibilities will be prioritized.
 
Performance Reviews
All employees receive formal performance reviews twice per year in January and July. Performance reviews assess job performance, goal achievement, and areas for improvement. Employees should prepare a self-assessment before each review meeting. Performance ratings directly impact annual salary increases and bonuses. Managers provide continuous feedback throughout the year, not just during formal reviews.
